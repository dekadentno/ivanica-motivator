# What is this?

This is a little script that I've integrated in a cron-job on my laptop. Its purpose is to send a motivational picture to my gf's e-mail every day at 9 in the morning. She has her stuff going on, exams and shit, and if this idea helps her even a tiny bit, I'll be happy af.

## Known bugs:
* didn't handle empty directory exception because I'm lazy
